# Heart Disease (AI Class Project)
For AI class Project, this group will develop a predictive Heart Disease model based 
on UCI ML dataset
You can download the dataset at: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/>

## Setting up the Environment
1. Programming Language: Python version 3.5+ 
2. Package Manager: Anaconda
3. IDE: IntelliJ

### Setting up Python 3.5
Unix systems have Python already Pre-installed. On Linux, default version is Python 2.7.

### Setting up a Package Manager
* Anaconda is the most popular package manager for Python. It makes it painless to add libraries to your project. 
* Download Anaconda (Python 3.6) for your OS version at: <https://www.anaconda.com/download/> For installation instructions for your OS,
check <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>

### Setting up IntelliJ's Pycharm
* Download Pycharm Professional edition. It has some nifty features not found in community edition, though
community edition would also suffice for this Project. 

#### Setting up your first project
* Create a folder anywhere
* Open Pycharm; file->open->project folder
* Set environment to use Python 3.6;file -> settings -> Project: project name -> select Python 3.6 from dropdown (~/anaconda3/bin/python)
* Note: Your config might be slightly different from mine

## Training and Prediction
### [Scikit Learn] (http://scikit-learn.org/)
* A Machine Learning Library for Python
* Example: Decision Trees: (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html). Approx. 10 lines of code to train, test, predict

### Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib....
* Useful Python libraries for data manipulation
* Numpy: Mostly used for Array Manipulations
* Pandas: A Python Data Structure(s) for data manipulations
* Matplotlib.....
